                        I am looking for membership prices. How much does it
                        cost to join?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        Pricing will vary depending on your location, but the
                        average cost of monthly membership is $41 in the United
                        States, and $53 in Canada. Club dues, monthly fees and
                        any additional charges are specific to each
                        independently owned gym.

                    <p>
                        We do! Our community is our priority and we are happy to
                        offer student, senior and military discounts as well as
                        insurance discounts.

                    <p>
                        Yes! It’s just one more reason to love SaZa! However,
                        there is one exception. There is a 30-day delay on
                        reciprocity when you initially begin your membership.

                    <p>
                        Yes, we do! Making healthy happen should be as easy as
                        possible and the option to take a quick shower after a
                        workout is sometimes the difference between “I can work
                        out” and “I can’t work out.” While all clubs have
                        showers and bathrooms, not all locations offer lockers.

                    <p>
                        None of our clubs offer sauna or steam rooms, but some
                        clubs do offer tanning and hydromassage beds.

                    <p>
                        SaZa Fitness does not offer basketball courts or
                        swimming pools.

                    <p>
                        While many SaZa Fitness locations offer Wifi in their
                        club, it is up to the owner to make it available to
                        members. Don’t hesitate to ask your local club if you do
                        not find the login information readily posted.

                        How old do you have to be to workout at SaZa Fitness? Is
                        there a minimum age to join?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        While there isn’t a set age limit, each of our SaZa
                        Fitness locations must comply with state laws on age
                        requirements and age restrictions. Check in with your
                        local gym to learn what the age policy is near you.

                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        If you would like to change payment settings, update
                        billing or change the credit card on your account,
                        please reach out to our billing provider, ABC Financial
                        Services, at 888-827-9262.

                        What happens if I miss a payment? Is there a late fee?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        A missed payment may result in a late payment fee. Late
                        payment penalty fees and fines are outlined in your
                        membership agreement.
