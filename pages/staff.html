                    to the elderly. I am committed to making training fun,
                    efficient and enjoyable! Let's build your body together with

                    I have been a trainer for four years and have experience as
                    an osteopath, fitness club instructor and personal trainer.
                    I will provide training guidance in a fun way so that you
                    can consider training habits as part of your life through
                    training.

                    I discovered yoga during my busy working life. What I
                    thought I couldn't do, I was able to do. Yoga gave me pure
                    joy that I had almost forgotten, as I was living in a
                    routine. I then took a teacher training course in Bali, and
                    I still cherish the encounters I have had and continue to
                    learn and grow. I would like to make classes with everyone
                    at Agni Yoga easy, fun and cheerful. I look forward to
                    seeing you at the studio.
